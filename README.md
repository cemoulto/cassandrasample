Code samples using DataStax Cassandra Java driver API

This is a plain java maven project. It's working with Java 1.7.x onwards along with Maven 3.x

All code snippets are fairly simple to explain getting started with DataStax Cassandra Java Driver API in an application.

I have provided examples for

Direct execute statements (like plain old JDBC style)
Prepared Statements
Batch Statements

It expects Cassandra instance to be running on the same machine.
